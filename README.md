# This contains the input scripts and related files only to run a concurrent coupled simulation using MOOSE-LAMMPS 'Discoflux' model. MOOSE is the driving code and LAMMPS used as library.

The code and executable is located at:

To build that code, first checkout the main moose to branch 'CP-CDT-LAMMPS'.

clone this repo to:

Any simulation should be run within branch "Coupled_CPFE-MD"


This is used to extract constitutive laws related to interaction betwen material and laser for Additive Manufacturing models.
