# This contains the iput scripts and related files to run a concurrent coupled simulation using MOOSE-LAMMPS 'Discoflux' model. MOOSE is the driving code and LAMMPS used as library.

The code and executable is located at "/users/schakraborty/MyRepository/moose_lammps/"

clone this repo to /lustre/scratch5/schakraborty/MySimulations/

Any simulation should be run within "/lustre/scratch5/schakraborty/MySimulations/Coupled_CPFE-MD"


This is used to ectract constititive laws related to interaction betwen material and laser for Additive MAnufacturing models.
