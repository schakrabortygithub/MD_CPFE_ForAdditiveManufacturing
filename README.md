# This contains the input scripts and related files only to run a concurrent coupled simulation using MOOSE-LAMMPS 'Discoflux' model. MOOSE is the driving code and LAMMPS used as library.

The code and executable is located at "/lustre/scratch5/schakraborty/MyRepository/moose_lammps/"

To build that code, first checkout the main moose to branch 'CP-CDT-LAMMPS'.

clone this repo to /lustre/scratch5/schakraborty/MySimulations/

Any simulation should be run within "/lustre/scratch5/schakraborty/MySimulations/Coupled_CPFE-MD"


This is used to ectract constititive laws related to interaction betwen material and laser for Additive MAnufacturing models.
